# City Traffic Signal Waiting Time Analysis (EDA)

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on city traffic signal waiting times to study congestion patterns across different signals and hours of the day using synthetic data.

## Objective
- Analyze traffic signal waiting times
- Identify peak congestion hours
- Compare congestion levels across multiple traffic signals

## Dataset
- Synthetic dataset generated using Python
- Columns:
  - Signal – Traffic signal ID
  - Hour – Hour of the day (0–23)
  - Waiting_Time_Seconds – Average waiting time in seconds

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Analysis & Visualizations
- Descriptive statistics for waiting times
- Line plots showing congestion trends over time
- Heatmap visualizing congestion intensity across signals and hours

## Key Insights
- Peak congestion occurs during morning and evening rush hours
- Certain signals consistently experience higher waiting times
- Heatmaps clearly highlight high-traffic periods

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
   
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
